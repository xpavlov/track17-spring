Today, the city's oldest district, founded as a fur trading post in 1605 by Samuel de Champlain, is a mélange of shops, bars and sidewalk cafes that attracts visitors and locals in equal measure.
It's also become the hip place to crash on a Montreal sojourn, with hotels like Le Petit Hôtel and the new Hotel William Gray creatively adapting old buildings into cool places to stay.
Thirty years ago, this wasn't the case. Many of the Vieux-Montréal structures were vacant, and most of the residents had fled to other areas, draining the neighborhood of life. But since listed historical buildings cannot be torn down, in recent years people began renovating them into modern business, entertainment and residential spaces.
Among the neighborhood landmarks are the Notre-Dame Basilica, the Pointe-à-Callière museum of history and archeology and the Old Port (Vieux-Port) where bygone docks, warehouses and grain silos have morphed into venues for summer swimming, winter ice skating, food festivals and IMAX films.
While the exact details of the project's logistics are yet to be revealed, Dubai's RTA says the futuristic venture is part of a strategy to have self-driving vehicles (of all kinds) account for a quarter of journeys made in Dubai, by 2030.
"This project supports Dubai's government's direction to become the smartest city in the world," HE Mattar Al Tayer, director general of RTA, said in an email to CNN.
He adds that the drones, which he refers to as Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (AAV), are an easy-to-use innovation that can transport up to 100 kilograms -- enough for one person and a suitcase -- on a pre-programmed route through the city.
"The passenger just needs to pick the destination through a smart screen [once inside the vehicle] and the AAV takes care of the rest."
